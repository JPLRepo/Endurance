	@description = A large and extraordinary science box designed to work with the Endurance system. It contains a specialy made bio-dome and ecology testing system filled with various samples and substrates from Kerbin, and tools for sampling a new world and its interaction with the onboard samples. Time and resources truly are required in order to properly operate this device, and it may only be used at attractive atmospheric worlds.

	description = It's not enough to wipe off our telescope, point at it, and crunch numbers from home on Kerbin every time a nice world with atmosphere comes around. We've got to hang around in low orbit of it and science every photon of daylight out of it to make certain how friendly it can be to kerbalkind. This experiment can run while in low orbit of any atmosphere body.
	!RESULTS {}
	RESULTS
	{
		default = This environment is sorely lacking in aspects that we are hoping for, or too excessive in aspects we would hope against. It would be unwise to settle here but we gained some good science for our time.
		SunInSpace = Don't do this, please. Don't do this.
		KerbinInSpace = Observing our own planet has yielded a bit more novel data than we expected. But the best part is that nothing spontaneously crumbled or blew up!
		MunInSpace = The Mun has so much Alumina in it that it's not funny. Sure there are other things but there's not much we can do if we were forced to depend on only the Mun. Let's move along.
		MinmusInSpace = We thought the Mun was bad... Not only is Minmus worse than it as a candidate for a new homeworld... Its composition is far from that of ice cream. We can't let this information get out.
		EveInSpace = Eve's atmosphere is rather hot and unfavorable. And its surface is extreme but that same atmosphere is far better able to stop any potential asteroid threat, and its composition has a very appealing balance. We'd love to land here but it's too hostile and too close to home. We've spent too much time and science just to build an interstellar ship to come and camp out here.
		DunaInSpace = There's almost a poetic nature to these results. Duna's rather short in a few fields, especially where the atmosphere and ecologies are concerned. But it's doing strong in a few others. This knowledge is reassuring to those of us who want to colonize Duna, but is still not enough to persaude those of us who do not believe. It may be best that we move along.
		IkeInSpace = We like Ike. We like Ike very much... Except that there is no atmosphere and its gravity is so low. Sorry, Ike.
		JoolInSpace = We'd like to have a word with whoever thought it was a good idea to run this kind of experiment on a gas giant.
		LaytheInSpace = Between Kerbin as we know it, and our expectations of a younger world that could become as Kerbin in a few millenia, Laythe is in pretty great shape. We should land this and science it ASAP!
		TyloInSpace:NEEDS[!JNSQ] = There is quite a lot of promise in Tylo. Its amazing mass and its composition prove very appealing for colonization. But its lack of atmosphere is quite a drawback. Living underground is not a problem if we must resort to it...but who's going to enjoy that in the long-run?
		TyloInSpace:NEEDS[JNSQ] = Tylo seems very promising, having a decent composition and atmosphere, and Tylo seems to have adequate protection from cosmic radiation. Let's pry a little further and land this box.
		EelooInSpace = We have found it to be rather worrisome this far out. Even with an atmosphere, an ice world such as this is not encouraging.
		LindorInSpace = We'd like to have a word with whoever thought it was a good idea to run this kind of experiment on a gas giant.
		HuygenInSpace = Huygen is pretty... interesting. Lots of useful potential in some industrial arenas but we're not too sure yet that it is homeworld material.
		RigaInSpace = Riga is okay, having a decent composition and atmosphere, but we're fearful of its lack of radiation shielding due to its size and its distance from Lindor. It may yet be worth our time to explore further.
		SarnusInSpace = We'd like to have a word with whoever thought it was a good idea to run this kind of experiment on a gas giant.
		SlateInSpace = There is quite a lot of promise in Slate. Its amazing mass and its composition prove very appealing for colonization. But its lack of atmosphere is quite a drawback. Living underground is not a problem if we must resort to it...but who's going to enjoy that in the long-run?...We can stay a while and think things over some more.
		TektoInSpace = Tekto is pretty... interesting. Lots of useful potential in some industrial arenas but we're not too sure yet that it is homeworld material.
		UrlumInSpace = We'd like to have a word with whoever thought it was a good idea to run this kind of experiment on a gas giant.
		NeidonInSpace = We'd like to have a word with whoever thought it was a good idea to run this kind of experiment on a gas giant.
		ThatmoInSpace = We have found it to be rather worrisome this far out. Even with an atmosphere, an ice world such as this is not encouraging.
		GaelInSpace = This planet has proven quite promising. It seems to be a perfect instance of Kerbin and begs to be landed on.
		TellumoInSpace = With the kind of costs required to get here we're not feeling too sure about going in...but there's no arguing that it would be worth it to confirm this planet with a landing.
		NodensInSpace:NEEDS[GPP,!GPP_Secondary] = This is the most peculiar thing we've come across. The spectral profile is on the spot like a younger Gael! But it's really purple and we don't know why.
		NodensInSpace:NEEDS[!GPP|GPP_Secondary] = This is the most peculiar thing we've come across. The spectral profile is on the spot like a younger Kerbin! But it's really purple and we don't know why.
		LindorInSpace = We'd like to have a word with whoever thought it was a good idea to run this kind of experiment on a gas giant.
		OthoInSpace = We'd like to have a word with whoever thought it was a good idea to run this kind of experiment on a gas giant.
		GaussInSpace = We'd like to have a word with whoever thought it was a good idea to run this kind of experiment on a gas giant.
		CatullusInSpace = We'd like to have a word with whoever thought it was a good idea to run this kind of experiment on a... Is this really a gas giant? It's rather small.
		NeroInSpace = We'd like to have a word with whoever thought it was a good idea to run this kind of experiment on a gas giant.
		SironaInSpace = We'd like to have a word with whoever thought it was a good idea to run this kind of experiment on a gas giant.

	description = With many sleepless nights, a few ethical pot-holes, and several liters of hot chocolate, we have assembled the single greatest experiment yet known for the sole purpose of creating and observing a small, autonomous bio-dome and seeing how it responds to several choice samples from a planet or moon that we have deemed a great candidate for colonization via the orbital assessment.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = The experiment has consistently produced positive results. We are definitely looking at a great candidate.
		KerbinSrfLanded = We've done well to build up a large database of reference data and trial-run the system. Now let's try another planet.
		// EveSrfLanded = Eve's composition is quite wonderful...once we look past the kerosene in several of the ground samples and the extreme ambient heat.
		// DunaSrfLanded = Duna has not performed well for us in the unshielded portions of the tests. And even in the shielded tests, mutations and failures have occurred or were projected to occur due to the high presence of radioactive ores in the deep crust.
		LaytheSrfLanded = Laythe's volcanism has proven just a bit troublesome but just as we expected, this moon ticks all the boxes. It's an 8.5 or 9 out of 10.
		// IkeSrfLanded = While Ike has no atmosphere to speak of, and exceedinly low gravity, its proximity to Duna compensates well, to some extent, and by itself, Ike is great. But we cannot look past the lack of atmosphere, radiation protection and gavity.
		// TyloSrfLanded:NEEDS[!JNSQ] = Looking past the inherent disadvantages of an airless world and the initial burden of its high gravity, Tylo is actually a great place to setup large outposts. Underground, uncrewed settlements are the order of the day here. We're going to need a lot of large cupolas.
		TyloSrfLanded:NEEDS[JNSQ] = Tylo has performed well for us, though with some difficulty on one hand, and some pleasant surprises on the other hand due to its ice world traits and strong ammonia presence.
		HuygenSrfLanded = Huygen scored quite highly with its thick atmosphere and strong ammonia and methane presences. We've observed some unusual new results, and we're excited for what further biology experiments might yield. Just about the only things missing are atmospheric oxygen, ambient heat, and more gravity.
		RigaSrfLanded = Riga scored pretty highly with its strong ammonia and methane presences. We've observed some unusual new results and we're excited for what further biology experiments might yield. Sadly, Riga remains far from perfect.
		// SlateSrfLanded = Looking past the inherent disadvantages of an airless world and the initial burden of its high gravity, Slate is actually a great place to setup large outposts. Underground, uncrewed settlements are the order of the day here. We're going to need a lot of large cupolas.
		TektoSrfLanded = Tekto scored quite highly with its thick atmosphere and strong ammonia and methane presences. We've observed some unusual new results, and we're excited for what further biology experiments might yield. Just about the only things missing are atmospheric oxygen, ambient heat, and more gravity.
		GaelSrfLanded = We've fond and confirmed a winner here. Gael is clearly cut from the same cloth as Kerbin.
		GratianSrfLanded = The soil of this red planet is as good as any homeworld candidate for supporting life. But we had to bring our own compost, water and some other essentials that don't occur here. Once those needs were met, the test plants blossomed just as they would back home.
		TellumoSrfLanded = We've found perfection in what this planet offers. Of course, the high atmosphere pressure and extra gravity do cause some concern, but we made the effort to land here. That effort was without a doubt, completely worth it.
		NodensSrfLanded:NEEDS[GPP,!GPP_Secondary] = This purple world has proven to be surprisingly hospitable. As far as we're concerned, Gael is Vanilla ice cream. Nodens is Coconut flavor. Sufficiently different yet having no wild and contentious flavor. In the meantime we have confirmed that the purple of the plants is due to their adapting to the red light of Grannus.
		NodensSrfLanded:NEEDS[!GPP|GPP_Secondary] = This purple world has proven to be surprisingly hospitable. As far as we're concerned, Kerbin is Vanilla ice cream. Nodens is Coconut flavor. Sufficiently different yet having no wild and contentious flavor. In the meantime we have confirmed that the purple of the plants is due to their adapting to the red light of Grannus.
